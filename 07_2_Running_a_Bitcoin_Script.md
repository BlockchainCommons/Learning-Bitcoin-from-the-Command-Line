# 7.2: Running a Bitcoin Script

> **NOTE:** This is a draft in progress, so that I can get some feedback from early reviewers. It is not yet ready for learning.

Bitcoin Scripts may not initially seem that intuitive, but their execution is quite simple, using reverse Polish notation and a stack.

## Running Bitcoin Script code

It is recommended that you run through the examples in a Bitcoin Script Debugger (`btcdeb`) to see the transformations happening
on the stack. This will require setting up C++ and a few other accessories on your machine, so choose if you want to add this additional material to your machine.

### Installing btcdeb

From some appropriate folder (e.g. `~/workspace`), clone the btcdeb project from Github and compile/install it. 

```Bash
$ sudo apt-get install git
$ git clone https://github.com/kallewoof/btcdeb.git
```
Then, get C++ and other packages installed, so that you can get `btcdeb` running.
```Bash
$ sudo apt-get install autoconf
$ sudo apt-get install libtool
$ sudo apt-get install g++
$ sudo apt-get install pkg-config
$ sudo apt-get install make

$ cd btcdeb
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
```
After all of that, you should have a copy of `btcdeb`:
```
$ which btcdeb
/usr/local/bin/btcdeb
```
It is recommended that you all install readline, as this makes the debugger a lot easier to use by supporting history using up/down arrows, left-right movement, autocompletion using tab, etc. The package is usually called `libreadline-dev` (linux) or just `readline` (mac).
```Bash
$ sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev
```

### Bitcoin Script Debugging Primer

`btcdeb` takes a script, as well as any number of stack entries, as startup arguments. If you start it up with no arguments, you simply get an interpreter
where you may issue `exec [opcode]` commands to perform actions directly.

`btcc` takes script opcodes and data and outputs a Bitcoin Script in hexadecimal form.

We will make use of both of these in the sections below.

## Understand the Scripting Language

A Bitcoin Script has three parts: it has a line of input; it has a stack for storage; and it has specific commands for execution.

### Understand the Ordering

Bitcoin Scripts are run from left to right. That sounds easy enough, because it's the same way you read. However, it might actually be the most non-intuitive element of Bitcoin Script, because it means that functions don't look like you'd expect. Instead, _the operands go before the operator._

For example, if you were adding together "1" and "2", your Bitcoin Script for that would be `1 2 OP_ADD`, _not_ "1 + 2". Since we know that OP_ADD operator takes two inputs, we know that the two inputs before it are its operands.

> **WARNING:** Technically, everything in Bitcoin Script is an opcode, thus it would be most appropriate to record the above example as `OP_1 OP_2 OP_ADD`. In our examples, we don't worry about how the constants will be evaluated, as that's a topic of translation, as is explained in [ยง8.2: Building the Structure of P2SH](08_2_Building_the_Structure_of_P2SH.md). Some writers prefer to also leave the "OP" prefix off all operators, but we have opted not to.

### Understand the Stack

It's actually not quite correct to say that an operator applies to the inputs before it. Really, an operator applies to the top inputs in Bitcoin's stack.

_What is a stack?_ A stack is a LIFO (last-in-first-out) data structure. It has two access functions: push and pop. Push places a new object on top of the stack, pushing down everything below it. Pop removes the top object from the stack.

Whenever Bitcoin Script encounters a constant, it pushes it on the stack. So the above example of `1 2 OP_ADD` would actually look like this as it was processed:
```
Script: 1 2 OP_ADD
Stack: [ ]

Script: 2 OP_ADD
Stack: [ 1 ]

Script: OP_ADD
Stack: [ 1 2 ]
```
_Note that in this and in following examples the top of the stack is to the right and the bottom is to the left._

Let's try this out:
```Bash
$ btcc OP_1 OP_2 OP_ADD
515293
$ btcdeb '[OP_1 OP_2 OP_ADD]' # or: btcdeb 0x515293
btcdeb -- type `btcdeb -h` for start up options
valid script
3 op script loaded. type `help` for usage information
script  |  stack
--------+--------
1       |
2       |
OP_ADD  |
#0001 1
btcdeb> step
		<> PUSH stack 01
script  |  stack
--------+--------
2       |      01
OP_ADD  |
#0002 2
btcdeb> step
		<> PUSH stack 02
script  |  stack
--------+--------
OP_ADD  |      02
        |      01
#0003 OP_ADD
btcdeb> step
		<> POP  stack
		<> POP  stack
		<> PUSH stack 03
script  |  stack
--------+--------
        |      03
```

> `btcdeb` allows you to repeat the previous command by hitting enter. We will be doing this in subsequent examples, so don't be surprised about `btcdeb>` prompts with nothing as input. It is simply repeating the previous (often `step`) command.

### Understand the Opcodes

When a Bitcoin Script encounters an operator, it evaluates it. Each operator pops zero or more elements off the stack as inputs, usually one or two. It then processes them in a specific way before pushing zero or more elements back on the stack, usually one or two.

OP_ADD pops two items off the stack (here: 2 then 1), adds then together, and pushes the result back on the stack (here: 3).
```
Script:
Running: 1 2 OP_ADD
Stack: [ 3 ]
```

## Build Up Complexity

More complex scripts are created by running more commands in order. They need to be carefully evaluated from left to right, so that you can understand the state of the stack as each new command is run. It will constantly change, as a result of previous operators:
```
Script: 3 2 OP_ADD 4 OP_SUB
Stack: [ ]

Script: 2 OP_ADD 4 OP_SUB
Stack: [ 3 ]

Script: OP_ADD 4 OP_SUB
Stack: [ 3 2 ]

Script: 4 OP_SUB
Running: 3 2 OP_ADD
Stack: [ 5 ]

Script: OP_SUB
Stack: [ 5 4 ]

Script: 
Running: 5 4 OP_SUB
Stack: [ 1 ]
```

Let's try this one too:
```Bash
$ btcdeb '[OP_3 OP_2 OP_ADD OP_4 OP_SUB]'
btcdeb -- type `btcdeb -h` for start up options
valid script
5 op script loaded. type `help` for usage information
script  |  stack
--------+--------
3       |
2       |
OP_ADD  |
4       |
OP_SUB  |
#0001 3
btcdeb> step
		<> PUSH stack 03
script  |  stack
--------+--------
2       |      03
OP_ADD  |
4       |
OP_SUB  |
#0002 2
btcdeb>
		<> PUSH stack 02
script  |  stack
--------+--------
OP_ADD  |      02
4       |      03
OP_SUB  |
#0003 OP_ADD
btcdeb>
		<> POP  stack
		<> POP  stack
		<> PUSH stack 05
script  |  stack
--------+--------
4       |      05
OP_SUB  |
#0004 4
btcdeb>
		<> PUSH stack 04
script  |  stack
--------+--------
OP_SUB  |      04
        |      05
#0005 OP_SUB
btcdeb>
		<> POP  stack
		<> POP  stack
		<> PUSH stack 01
script  |  stack
--------+--------
        |      01
```

## Understand the Usage of Bitcoin Script

That's pretty much Bitcoin Scripting ... other than a few intricacies for how this scripting language interacts with Bitcoin itself.

### Understand scriptSig and scriptPubKey

As we've seen, every input for a Bitcoin transaction contains a `scriptSig` that is used to unlock the `scriptPubKey` for the associated UTXO. They are _effectively_ concatenated together, meaning that `scriptSig` and `scriptPubKey` are run together, in that order.

So, presume that a UTXO were locked with a `scriptPubKey` that read `OP_ADD 99 OP_EQUAL`, requiring as input two numbers that add up to ninety-nine, and presume that the `scriptSig` of `1 98` were run to unlock it. The two scripts would effectively be run in order as `1 98 OP_ADD 99 OP_EQUAL`.

Evaulate the result:
```
Script: 1 98 OP_ADD 99 OP_EQUAL
Stack: []

Script: 98 OP_ADD 99 OP_EQUAL
Stack: [ 1 ]

Script: OP_ADD 99 OP_EQUAL
Stack: [ 1 98 ]

Script: 99 OP_EQUAL
Running: 1 98 OP_ADD
Stack: [ 99 ]

Script: OP_EQUAL
Stack: [ 99 99 ]

Script: 
Running: 99 99 OP_EQUAL
Stack: [ True ]
```
This abstraction isn't quite accurate: for security reasons, the `scriptSig` is run, then the contents of the stack are transferred for the `scriptPubKey` to run, but it's accurate enough for understanding how the key of `scriptSig` fits into the lock of `scriptPubKey`.

> **WARNING** The above is a non-standard transaction type. It would not actually be accepted by nodes running Bitcoin Core with the standard settings. [ยง8.1: Building a Bitcoin Script with P2SH](08_1_Building_a_Bitcoin_Script_with_P2SH.md) discusses how you actually _could_ run a Bitcoin Script like this, using the power of P2SH.

### Get the Results

Bitcoin will verify a transaction and allow the UTXO to be respent if two criteria are met when running `scriptSig` and `scriptPubKey`:

   1. The execution did not get marked as invalid at any point, for example with a failed OP_VERIFY or the usage of a disabled opcode.
   2. The top item in the stack at the end of execution is true (non-zero).
   
In the above example, the transaction would succeed because the stack has a `True` at its top. But, it would be just as permissible to end with a full stack and the number `42` on top.

## Summary: Running a Bitcoin Script

To process a Bitcoin Script, a `scriptSig` is run followed by the `scriptPubKey` that it's unlocking. These commands are run in order, from left to right, with constants being pushed onto a stack and operators popping elements off that stack, then pushing results back onto it. If the Script doesn't halt in the middle and if the item on top of the stack at the end is non-zero, then the UTXO is unlocked.
