# Translating Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line

Thank you for your interest in translating Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line! What follows is our standard procedure for doing so. If you have any questions, please file an Issue.

1. **Please Follow Our Normal Contributor Procedure.**
   * Read over [Contributing.md](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
   * Fill out a [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/CLA.md) and submit it as a PR.
1. **Choose a Release.**  
   * Choose a [Release](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/releases) as the basis of your translation. We generally suggest the latest release. This will ensure the consistency of all the files in your translation, will insulate you from any changes we make, and will make it easy to see what has changed when we create a new release. 
   * If it looks like there hasn't been a new Release in a while, file an Issue saying you're interested in starting a new translation, and asking if it would make sense for there to be a new Release milestone before you do so. If there's been anything notable, and we're not in the middle of things, we'll likely create a new patch or minor version. If we're in the middle of things, we'll just suggest you use the previous Release.
   * Label your table of contents and each chapter or section with the release used.
1. **Request a Branch.**
   * File an [Issue](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/issues) requesting a new branch for your translation
   * This will be the master place for us to collect work on the translation over time.
   * We will create a top-level directory for your complete translation using the [ISO 639-1 language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes), for example `es` (Spanish), `fr` (French), or `pt` (Portuguese). Work should be done in that directory.
1. **Branch the Branch.**
   * Once we've created a translation branch, you'll then want to branch that into your own GitHub account.
1. **Submit PRs a Chapter at a Time.**
   * Submit your PRs for the translation from your working branch to our translation branch in batches of no more than a single chapter at a time.
   * Submit in smaller batches if it makes sense, for example because different people are writing different sections.
1. **Request Approval from a Native Speaker.**
   * No one can ever do a great edit of their own work, so we require each section to be approved by someone other than the original translator.
   * This fundamentally means that any translation team _should_ contain at least two members, either one translator and one editor or else two people who trade off roles of translator and editor. If your team doesn't have a second member, we can put out a call for an editor/approver when you submit a PR, but it's possible that we won't be able to find one, and your hard work will languish, so it's s better to have one up front.
1. **Request Approval from the Blockchain Commons Team.**
   * Once a chapter or section has been approved by a native speaker, request approval from someone on the Blockchain Commons team: currently [@shannona](https://github.com/shannona).
1. **Continue!**
   * Continue through the process, no more than one chapter at a time, until you have a full book.
   * Be aware of the scope of the overall project. As of v2.01, Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line is 120,000 words in length. As a book, that'd be 250-400 pages, depending on the format and layout. (About 80,000 words of that is text to translate, with the remainder being code.) You want to make sure you have the time for that level of commitment before getting started.
1. **Let Us Know When You're Done.**
   * When you've completed your translation, file an issue to let us know that the translation branch is ready to be merged into the master.
   * This will also let us know to announce the completed translation and link it into the master README
1. **Update Your Translation with New Releases**
   * It is our hope that translations will stay up to day with new releases, particularly major and minor releases, which are likely to include new content and updates. Currently, these only occur ever few years
   * If you have decided to stop updating a translation, please let us know in an Issue, so that we can let the community know that we are looking for a new translator to continue updating a translation.

Again, thank you!
