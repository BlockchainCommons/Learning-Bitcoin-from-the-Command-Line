# 4.5: Sending Coins with Automated Raw Transactions

> :information_source: **NOTE:** This is a draft in progress, so that I can get some feedback from early reviewers. It is not yet ready for learning.

This chapter lays out three ways to send funds via Bitcoin's cli interface. [ยง4.1](04_1_Sending_Coins_The_Easy_Way.md) described how to do so with a simple command, and [ยง4.4](04_4_Sending_Coins_with_a_Raw_Transaction.md) detailed how to use a more dangerous raw transaction. This final section splits the difference by showing how to make raw transactions simpler and safer. 

## Let Bitcoin Calculate For You

The methodology for automated raw transactions is simple: you create a raw transaction, but you use the `fundrawtransaction` command to ask the bitcoind to run the calculations for you.

In order to use this command, you'll need to ensure that your ~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf file contains rational variables for calculating transaction fees. Please see [ยง4.1: Sending Coins The Easy Way](04_1_Sending_Coins_The_Easy_Way.md) for more information on this.

For very conservative numbers, we suggested adding the following to the bitcoin.conf:
```
mintxfee=0.0001
txconfirmtarget=6
```
To keep the tutorial moving along (and more generally to move money fast) we suggested the following:
```
mintxfee=0.001
txconfirmtarget=1
```

## Create a Bare Bones Raw Transaction

To use `fundrawtransaction` you first need to create a bare-bones raw transaction that lists _no_ inputs and _no_ change address. You'll just list your recipient and how much you want to send them:
```
$ unfinishedtx=$(bitcoin-cli -named createrawtransaction inputs='''[]''' outputs='''{ "'$recipient'": 1.0 }''')
```

## Fund Your Bare Bones Transaction

You then tell `bitcoin-cli` to fund that bare-bones transaction:
```
$ bitcoin-cli -named fundrawtransaction hexstring=$unfinishedtx
{
  "hex": "020000000169847669938c6a66ef790b87ebb6233059609bee4601476c5948db1a4defc9690100000000feffffff02a8e30f05000000001976a914a6f0ee37c44947f4137d56e4aab12f27ad50369188ac00e1f505000000001976a914e7c1345fc8f87c68170b3aa798a956c2fe6a9eff88ac00000000",
  "changepos": 0,
  "fee": 0.00022600
}
```
That provides a lot of useful information, but once you're confident with how it works, you'll want to use JQ to save your hex to a variable, as usual:
```
$ rawtxhex3=$(bitcoin-cli -named fundrawtransaction hexstring=$unfinishedtx | jq -r '.hex')
```
## Verify Your Funded Transaction

It seems like magic, so the first few times you use `fundrawtransaction`, you'll probably want to verify it.

Running `decoderawtransaction` will show that the raw transaction is now laid out correctly, using one or more of your UTXOs and sending excess funds back to a change address:
```
$ bitcoin-cli -named decoderawtransaction hexstring=$rawtxhex3
{
  "txid": "2e34603b7449d29412fb7b0d184085d4d839d965f2bba361749c20d9dbae3d0b",
  "hash": "2e34603b7449d29412fb7b0d184085d4d839d965f2bba361749c20d9dbae3d0b",
  "size": 119,
  "vsize": 119,
  "version": 2,
  "locktime": 0,
  "vin": [
    {
      "txid": "69c9ef4d1adb48596c470146ee9b60593023b6eb870b79ef666a8c9369768469",
      "vout": 1,
      "scriptSig": {
        "asm": "",
        "hex": ""
      },
      "sequence": 4294967294
    }
  ],
  "vout": [
    {
      "value": 0.84927400,
      "n": 0,
      "scriptPubKey": {
        "asm": "OP_DUP OP_HASH160 123cd8796558d195e52137ce3800e5f8120ee46f OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG",
        "hex": "76a914123cd8796558d195e52137ce3800e5f8120ee46f88ac",
        "reqSigs": 1,
        "type": "pubkeyhash",
        "addresses": [
          "mhBPM8hU2PHjDTUvwa3SC7pqv8ExkK6mH8"
        ]
      }
    }, 
    {
      "value": 1.00000000,
      "n": 1,
      "scriptPubKey": {
        "asm": "OP_DUP OP_HASH160 e7c1345fc8f87c68170b3aa798a956c2fe6a9eff OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG",
        "hex": "76a914e7c1345fc8f87c68170b3aa798a956c2fe6a9eff88ac",
        "reqSigs": 1,
        "type": "pubkeyhash",
        "addresses": [
          "n2eMqTT929pb1RDNuqEnxdaLau1rxy3efi"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
We saw the fee in the more extensive output, before we saved the hex to a variable with JQ, but you can verify it with the `btctxfee` JQ alias:
```#Where is this command btxfee eralier specified? Can't find it?!
$ btctxfee $rawtxhex3
.00023
```
Finally, you can use `validateaddress` to see that the generated change address really belongs to you:
```
$ bitcoin-cli -named validateaddress address=mhBPM8hU2PHjDTUvwa3SC7pqv8ExkK6mH8
{
  "isvalid": true,
  "address": "mhBPM8hU2PHjDTUvwa3SC7pqv8ExkK6mH8",
  "scriptPubKey": "76a914123cd8796558d195e52137ce3800e5f8120ee46f88ac",
  "ismine": true,
  "iswatchonly": false,
  "isscript": false,
  "pubkey": "029045eaa55d283526c723e6d5495d9b3f077b545563f86465aafcd9bfdd50359e",Y
  "iscompressed": true,
  "timestamp": 1489170694,
  "hdkeypath": "m/0'/0'/11'",
  "hdmasterkeyid": "144a68bde927a1fed7c2b71ad9010b0201819be5"
}
```
Note the `ismine` results.

## Send Your Funded Transaction

At this point you can sign and send the transaction as usual.
```
$ signedtx3=$(bitcoin-cli -named signrawtransactionwithwallet hexstring=$rawtxhex3 | jq -r '.hex')
$ bitcoin-cli -named sendrawtransaction hexstring=$signedtx3
```
In several minutes, you'll have your change back:
```
$ bitcoin-cli listunspent
[
  {
    "txid": "37698ad6e7f62df07c2fbc549339aa680a7fa18328d7ad14ecb72b21c505cbc6",
    "vout": 0,
    "address": "mhBPM8hU2PHjDTUvwa3SC7pqv8ExkK6mH8",
    "scriptPubKey": "76a914123cd8796558d195e52137ce3800e5f8120ee46f88ac",
    "amount": 0.84927400,
    "confirmations": 1,
    "spendable": true,
    "solvable": true
  }
]
```

## Summary: Sending Coins with Automated Raw Transactions

If you must send funds with raw transactions then `fundrawtransaction` gives you a nice alternative where fees, inputs, and outputs are calculated for you, so you don't accidentally lose a bunch of money.

### Why Use Automated Raw Transactions

_The advantages._ It provides a nice balance. If you're sending funds by hand and `sendtoaddress` doesn't offer enough control for whatever reason, you can get some of the advantages of raw transactions without the dangers. This methodology should be used whenever possible if you're sending raw transactions by hand.

_The disadvantages._ It's a hodge-podge. Though there are a few additional options for the `fundrawtransaction` command that weren't mentioned here, your control is still limited. You'd probably never want to use this method if you were writing a program where the whole goal is to know exactly what's going on.
