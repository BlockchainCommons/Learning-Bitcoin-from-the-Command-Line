# 3.2: Knowing Your Bitcoin Setup

Before you start playing with Bitcoin, you may always want to come to a better understanding of your setup.

## Know Your Bitcoin Directory

To start with, you should understand where everything is kept: the `~/.bitcoin` directory.

The main directory just contains your config file and the testnet directory:
```
$ ls ~/.bitcoin
bitcoin.conf  testnet3
```
The setup guides in [Chapter Two: Creating a Bitcoin-Core VPS](02_0_Setting_Up_a_Bitcoin-Core_VPS.md) laid out a standardized config file. [§3.1: Verifying Your Bitcoin Setup](03_1_Verifying_Your_Bitcoin_Setup.md) suggested how to change it to support more advanced setups. If you're interested in learning even more about the config file, you may wish to consult [Jameson Lopp's Bitcoin Core Config Generator](https://jlopp.github.io/bitcoin-core-config-generator/).

Moving back to your ~/.bitcoin directory, you'll find that the testnet3 directory contains all of the guts:
```
$ ls ~/.bitcoin/testnet3
banlist.json   blocks	  debug.log	     mempool.dat	peers.dat
bitcoind.pid  chainstate  fee_estimates.dat  onion_private_key	wallets
```
You shouldn't mess with most of these files and directories — particularly not the `blocks` and `chainstate` directories, which contain all of the blockchain data, and the information in your `wallets` directory, which contains your personal wallet. However, do take careful note of the `debug.log` file, which you should refer to if you ever have problems with your setup.

> :link: **TESTNET vs MAINNET:** If you're using mainnet, then _everything_ will instead be placed in the main `~/.bitcoin` directory. These various setups _do_ elegantly stack, so if you are using mainnet, testnet, and regtest, you'll find that `~/.bitcoin` contains your config file and your mainnet data, the `~/.bitcoin/testnet3` directory contains your testnet data, and the `~/.bitcoin/regtest` directory contains your regtest data.

## Know Your Bitcoin-cli Commands

Most of your early work will be done with the `bitcoin-cli` command, which offers an easy interface to `bitcoind`. If you ever want more information on its usage, just run it with the `help` argument. Without any other arguments, it shows you every possible command:
```

You can also type `bitcoin-cli help [command]` to get even more extensive info on that command. For example:
```
$ bitcoin-cli help getmininginfo
...
Returns a json object containing mining-related information.
Result:
{                              (json object)
  "blocks" : n,                (numeric) The current block
  "currentblockweight" : n,    (numeric, optional) The block weight of the last assembled block (only present if a block was ever assembled)
  "currentblocktx" : n,        (numeric, optional) The number of block transactions of the last assembled block (only present if a block was ever assembled)
  "difficulty" : n,            (numeric) The current difficulty
  "networkhashps" : n,         (numeric) The network hashes per second
  "pooledtx" : n,              (numeric) The size of the mempool
  "chain" : "str",             (string) current network name (main, test, regtest)
  "warnings" : "str"           (string) any network and blockchain warnings
}

Examples:
> bitcoin-cli getmininginfo
> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id": "curltest", "method": "getmininginfo", "params": []}' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8332/
```
> :book: ***What is RPC?*** `bitcoin-cli` is just a handy interface that lets you send commands to the `bitcoind`. More specifically, it's an interface that lets you send RPC (or Remote Procedure Protocol) commands to the `bitcoind`. Often, the `bitcoin-cli` command and the RPC command have identical names and interfaces, but some `bitcoin-cli` commands instead provide shortcuts for more complex RPC requests. Generally, the `bitcoin-cli` interface is much cleaner and simpler than trying to send RPC commands by hand, using `curl` or some other method. However, it also has limitations as to what you can ultimately do.

## Optional: Know Your Bitcoin Info

A variety of bitcoin-cli commands can give you additional information on your bitcoin data. The most general ones are:

`bitcoin-cli -getinfo` returns information from different RPCs (user-friendly)

```diff
$ bitcoin-cli -getinfo

```

Other commands to get information about blockchain, mining, network, wallet etc.

```
$ bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo
$ bitcoin-cli getmininginfo
$ bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo
$ bitcoin-cli getnettotals
$ bitcoin-cli getwalletinfo
```
For example `bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo` gives you a variety of information on your setup and its access to various networks:
```
$ bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo
{
  "version": 200000,
  "subversion": "/Satoshi:0.20.0/",
  "protocolversion": 70015,

      "proxy": "127.0.0.1:9050",
      "proxy_randomize_credentials": true
    }
  ],
  "relayfee": 0.00001000,
  "incrementalfee": 0.00001000,
  "localaddresses": [
    {

    {

    }

}
```
Feel free to reference any of these and to use "bitcoin-cli help" if you want more information on what any of them do.

## Summary: Knowing Your Bitcoin Setup

The `~/.bitcoin` directory contains all of your files, while `bitcoin-cli help` and a variety of info commands can be used to get more information on how your setup and Bitcoin work.
