# Chapter Three: Understanding Your Bitcoin Setup

You're now ready to begin working with the `bitcoin-cli` command-line interface. But that first requires that you understand your Bitcoin setup and its wallet features, which is what will be explained in this chapter.

For this and future chapters, we presume that you have a VPS with Bitcoin installed, running `bitcoind`. We also presume that you are connected to testnet, allowing for access to bitcoins without using real funds. You can either do this with Bitcoin Standup at Linode.com, per [ยง2.1: Setting up a Bitcoin-Core VPS with Bitcoin Standup](02_1_Setting_Up_a_Bitcoin-Core_VPS_with_StackScript.md), or via other means, per [ยง2.2: Setting up a Bitcoin-Core Machine via Other Means](02_2_Setting_Up_Bitcoin_Core_Other.md).
