# Chapter 18: Understanding Your Lighting Setup

> :information_source: **NOTE:** This is a draft in progress, so that I can get some feedback from early reviewers. It is not yet ready for learning.

The previous chapter concluded our work with Bitcoin proper, through CLI, scripting, and programming languages. However, there are many other utilities within the Bitcoin ecosystem: this chapter and the cover the largest. Here you'll begin work with the `lightning-cli` command-line interface, first by understanding c-lightning setup and its features — which is what will be explained with some examples and basic configuration.

## Objectives for This Chapter

After working through this chapter, a developer will be able to:

   * Assess that a C-lightning Node is Installed and Up-to-date
   * Perform Casic Lightning Wallet Commands
   * Create a LIghtning Channel
   
Supporting objectives include the ability to:
